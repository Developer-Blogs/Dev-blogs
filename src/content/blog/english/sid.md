Managing multiple passwords can be overwhelming, but Keeper offers a simple solution. Keeper is a password manager that allows users to securely store, view, and manage their passwords. Built with the MERN stack, it provides users with an easy-to-use interface.

### Project Purpose and Objectives
Keeper was developed to provide users with a secure and efficient way to manage their passwords. The primary objectives of the project were to create an intuitive user interface for storing and retrieving passwords, Ultimately, Keeper aims to simplify password management, allowing users to focus on their tasks without worrying about remembering multiple passwords.

### Technologies and Tools Used
The Keeper project is built using the MERN stack, which includes:
- **MongoDB:** For storing user passwords in a database.
- **Express.js:** To handle server-side logic and API requests.
- **React.js:** For creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Node.js:**  To facilitate server-side operations and manage communication between the frontend and backend. Additionally, Axios is used for making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.

### Key Challenges Encountered and Solutions
- **User Experience:** Designing a user-friendly interface that is also functional was a challenge. To address this, we focused on creating a clean and intuitive layout, gathering user feedback, and making iterative improvements to enhance usability.
- **Data Management:** Organizing and retrieving a large number of passwords effectively was another challenge. We implemented a simple categorization feature to allow users to sort and filter their passwords easily.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Handling CORS issues while connecting the frontend and backend was tricky. We resolved this by configuring CORS in the Express.js server to allow requests from the frontend domain.

### Lessons Learned and Improvements Made
This project taught me the importance of creating a seamless user experience, particularly in applications that involve managing personal data. I learned to prioritize usability by conducting user testing and incorporating feedback into the design process. Additionally, I recognized the significance of efficient data management practices in ensuring that users can easily access their information. Moving forward, I plan to implement additional features, such as password categorization and searching, to further enhance the functionality of Keeper.
